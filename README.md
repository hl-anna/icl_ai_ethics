The main task of the assignment is to study model selection process (when training ML models) that takes into account accuracy and fairness metrics.
The task is to compare standard ML models versus fairness-based ML models with three model selection criteria:

*   Most accurate
*   Most fair
*   Most accurate & fair

This repository contains three colab notebooks: 

- one for the AdultDataset (ML_Fairness_Cw_Adult.ipynb)
- one for the CompasDataset (ML_Fairness_Cw_Compas.ipynb)
- and one for the additional analysis (ML_Fairness_Cw_Additional.ipynb).

These can be all run out of the box and each notebook has an outline for easier navigation.

Note: One of the aif360 module import fails sometimes and gives an error. If that happens, one only needs to re-run the cell (this import cell is the 4th cell in all three notebooks) and the error disappears.
